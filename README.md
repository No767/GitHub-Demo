# GitHub-Demo

Well hello there ! This repo is for an American Lit project, where we teach the class anything we want. And naturally, I choose "making your first pull request". So this is a repo for that. 

So, you may also have noticed about that "exmaple project" folder. Well, this is an example project to show how github actually works. The project is an Next.js website using TypeScript and pnpm. To get started, install pnpm [here](https://pnpm.io/installation), and run this cmd (bash):

```sh
git clone [forked cloned repo] && cd example-project && pnpm install 
```

also make sure u have node.js installed
